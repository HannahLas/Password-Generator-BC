# Password-Generator-BC

## My fifth challenge with the edX Bootcamp

I completed this task for the fith challenge in my Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development. I was tasked with creating code for a password generator using JavsScript. I was provided with arrays and comments in the starter code, along with code to generate buttons.  I wrote JavaScript code to create a random password. This task aimed to use the JavaScript skills I had learned during the week.  I used functions, objects, variables, if conditional statements and for loops. 

## Usage
Click on the generate password button and follow the prompts to create a secure password.  Below is a link to a screenshot that shows which button you need to press and shows the first prompt on the site.

## Acknowledgements

I had a tutor session to help me understand how to use objects. This led me to declare passwordCriteria as an object. This session also helped me to understand how to use the concat method to create a new array from the criteria that the user had selected. This session also helped to understand that I needed to declare variables for each of the password options and write if statements.
